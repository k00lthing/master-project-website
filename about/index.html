    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <section class="ocr-info">
      <h3>Idea</h3>
      <p class="hyphenate">This project started with a contemplating about readability, legibility, and its role in type
        design. The theory goes as follows: legibility is the ease with which a reader can decode individual symbols,
        while readably is the ease with which a reader can follow and understand words, sentences, and paragraphs.
        Traditionally, type design practitioners strive to construct their typefaces to be legible and readable in all
        different situations and applications, which is a long and dire process involving lots of compromises. But who
        tells what is legible and/or readable? And what is legible and/or readable for whom?</p>

      <p class="hyphenate">The technology of optical character recognition (OCR) has become a ubiquitous and essential
        part of many applications. I, personally, used it for a long time without giving it much though, until I watched
        <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/31c3_-_6558_-_de_-_saal_g_-_201412282300_-_traue_keinem_scan_den_du_nicht_selbst_gefalscht_hast_-_david_kriesel#t=1449"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Kriesel’s 2014 CCC congress talk “Don't trust any scan that
          you haven't faked yourself” (originally in German “Traue keinem Scan, den du nicht selbst gefälscht
          hast“)</a>. The case revolves around XEROX copy machines mysteriously changing numbers on scanned documents.
        David goes to the bottom of it and discovers that the problem is caused by pattern matching of JBig2 image
        compression algorithm. Dangerous little error, causing thousands of scanned documents to be infested with wrong
        data. It got me thinking about optical character recognition systems, which in some sense is also a scanning
        process. Normally, one would want an OCR system to recognise the text perfectly. Imagine, how great it can be —
        snap a photo or screenshot and just copy the text on the picture instead of tedious typing down the text from
        the picture. But what if I don’t want my text to be recognisable? Can I have a text, legible and/or readable for
        humans, but problematic for OCR software? </p>

      <p class="hyphenate">Type design has been on my radar for some time, I even extended the character sets of some
        typefaces (for example, if I needed Latin extended characters like ü, å or ø), but I never designed a complete
        typeface before. Now I wanted to start a series of typographic experiments in order to design type, which is
        readable only by humans. To limit my experiments, I decided to only use traditional graphic designer “weapons” —
        space and negative space, along with OpenType features, which give me control over glyph position and
        substitution and Variable Font technology.</p>

      <h3>Outline</h3>
      <p class="hyphenate">As a first step, I needed to figure out some strategy. After extensive reading on how OCR
        works, testing some typefaces with an OCR system of my choice, and asking questions about how we humans read and
        how our brain helps us find patterns and address the information deficiencies, three strategies have been
        developed. The first one plays with the human capability of recognising the letter shape, the second uses our
        ability to fill the gaps and the third one employs the ability of spatial reasoning.</p>

      <a class="link" href="/disorientation" title="To the Disorientation Sans VF page " target="_blank">More about Disorientation Sans VF</a>

      <p class="hyphenate">For each strategy I decided to draw a basic set of glyphs A-Z, a-z and 0-9, leaving out
        punctuation, symbols, and marks. For the resulting three typefaces, I conducted a series of tests to determine
        how well the text set in this typeface will be recognised by Tesseract, the OCR of my choice. Testing my three
        typefaces — Resolution Display VF, Disruption Monospace VF and Disorientation Sans VF brought some interesting
        and sometimes unexpected results as well as raised questions about score reliability of deep learning software.
