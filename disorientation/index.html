    <h2>Disorientation Sans Variable Font</h2>
    <p class="subline">sans-serif typeface</p>
    <section class="info">
      <h3>Concept</h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p class="hyphenate">This strategy falls in the footsteps of one of the implementation intended to separate bots
          from humans — the CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart), which
          was created at Carnegie Mellon University in 2000. Since then, a lot of websites use different forms of
          CAPTCHAs to guard against the spambots and other malicious software implementations. Classic CAPTCHAs, which
          are still in use on some web properties today, involve asking users to identify letters. The letters are
          distorted so that bots are not likely to be able to identify them. Such tests are rather common in
          login/signup forms, online polls, and e-commerce checkout pages.</p>

        <p class="hyphenate">Similar to Disruption Monospace VF, I started with drawing a neutral sans-serif font, which
          will be used as a base for this typographic experiment. For this typeface, I wanted to create a more ‘erratic’
          look, utilising OpenType glyph replacement features: ligatures and contextual alternatives.</p>

        <p class="hyphenate">Next, a very big decision was to be made — what letter combinations will become ligatures
          and what letters should get contextual alternatives? As a starting point, I had a look at something, some
          German-speaking typographers call “schnapps-words” (named so as a tribute to double-vision one gets from
          indulging a bit too much alcohol) case, when a word contains double letters, like ‘buggy’ or ‘missing’. But it
          is a minor deviation in a sentence, since “schnapps-words” are not very common.</p>
        <p class="hyphenate">Cryptography researchers of the University of Notre Dame published statistics of <a
            href="https://www3.nd.edu/~busiforc/handouts/cryptography/Letter%20Frequencies.html#Most_common_bigrams_.28in_order.29"
            target="_blank">letter frequencies in the English language</a>. The analysis of 9,481 English works from
          Project Gutenberg (plain text files only, minus the human genome project, non-English works, and duplicates)
          yielded frequencies of letters, bigrams, trigrams and quadrigrams. Of 2,383,373,483 bigrams scanned
          researchers ranked 20 most frequent, which I took as a second set of ligatures.</p>

        <p class="hyphenate">Disruption Monospace VF is drafted as a variable font with two axes of variation —
          horizontal and vertical. All variations are applied to ligatures and contextual alternatives only. For the
          horizontal variation, I slanted the ligatures slant up or down from 0 to 35°, which gave a visual effect of a
          glyph, rotated along its own middle axis. Vertical variation shifts the glyph to the point of first intersect
          with ascender or descender. To make the interpolation work, I needed at least three master drawings — one for
          no advance, one for max. horizontal advance and one for max. vertical advance.</p>

        <p class="hyphenate">To bring some variation in the substitution process, for each ligature I drew 4 variations
          and two variations for numerals. Along the horizontal axis, the following variations exist: (1) first letter
          slanted 35° down, last letter slanted 35° up (2) both letters slanted 35° down (3) both letters slanted 35° up
          and (4) first letter slanted 35° up, last letter slanted 35° down. Along the vertical axis, the following
          variations exist: (1)second letter pulled up to align with ascender, (2) first letter pulled up to align with
          ascender, (3) both letters pulled up to ascender, (4) both letters pulled down to descender.
        <p>

        <p class="hyphenate">The decision on which glyph used for substitution is being managed by three little “loops”
          written in the OpenType feature language, making sure no two same ligatures are placed next to each other.
        <p>

        <p class="hyphenate">Those rules laid a solid base, but I was craving a bit more going on here. So I introduced
          initial and final forms of the letter — every uppercase letter got 2 variations for initial forms (letter is
          first one in the word) and every lowercase letter got 2 variations for final forms (letter is last in the
          word). Which variation to use, depends upon whether the word begins the sentence or used in-between. </p>

        <p class="hyphenate">After synchronising all rules and variations along three masters, the experiment grew up to
          1137 individual glyphs, which gives the typed sentence its signature eccentric look. </p>

      <h3>OCR testing</h3>
      <div class="description">
        <h4>Testing assets</h4>
        <p>The tests are conducted on the <a href="https://www.typography.com/blog/text-for-proofing-fonts">Hoefler's
            Proof 1.0</a>, which is an illustrative list of english words, organized logically. Using this list
          instead of classic pangrams allows to test the font's legibility and OCR recognition in a more realistic
          context.</p>
        <p>Since this font in not really optimized for small sizes, descision was made to pull the testing text apart
          for shorter strings and use larger font size, even though it may have some influence on the final OCR score.
          If we use larger font size and fewer words in testing, it will on one hand speed up the recognition process,
          but provide clearer shapes of letters for OCR to work with. After some consideration, it was also assumed,
          that
          in such case there will be also less context on the test page for OCR to support a decision to recognise shape
          as a letter, so in the end it seemed like a fair trade-off.</p>
        <p>In order to maintain uniformity, 9 testing sets were created - for 0, 50 and 100 along both axis.
          For each weight two sizes were selected: 40pt and 80pt, with line height 125% of font size.</p>
        <h4>Testing method</h4>
        <p>As a next step, test images containing sample text, set in selected font settings were generated. With 27
          images per font setting, there are altogether 243 testing images for Disorientation Sans VF. Those were loaded
          individually into the <a href="/ocr">OCR testing environment</a>, recognition results documented in a
          screenshots and a score table and later evaluated. </p>
