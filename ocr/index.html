      <span><p>Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is an open-source software library developed by Google that enables the recognition and extraction of text from various sources, such as images, scanned documents, and PDF files. It was initially developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in the 1980s, and later maintained and enhanced by different organizations.</p>
        Tesseract OCR utilizes machine learning algorithms and pattern recognition techniques to analyse the visual patterns of characters and convert them into machine-readable text. It supports over 100 languages, including major scripts like Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, and Chinese.
        The library has been widely adopted in various applications and industries. It provides APIs and command-line interfaces, making it accessible for developers to integrate into their software systems. Tesseract OCR can be used for tasks such as document digitization, text extraction from images for indexing and searching, automatic data entry, and more.</span>
